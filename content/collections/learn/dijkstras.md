title: Dijkstra's algorithm
slug: dijkstras
what: Finds the shortest path to all vertices in a Directed Weighted Graph (easily modified for undirected) given a start vertex.
how: Given a start vertex. | Put start vertex in queue (min-heap). | While queue is not empty... | Poll the queue for the current vertex. | Go through its adjacency list (list of edges). | For all edges, find neighbors and evaluate cost to get there from current. | If lower than current min, update min-heap with the new values.
averageTime: O(E log V) with a binary heap, because we go through all vertices and do poll() --> O(V log V). In the inner loop we go though all edges and possibly do a decreaseKey-operation --> O(E log V). Final complexity is O(V log V) + O(E log V) = O(E log V). With a fibonacci heap it's O(E + V log V).
space: Adjacency list --> O(V + E). Adjacency matrix --> O(V^2).

### Constraints
Original/simple version doesn't work with negative weights (but the below does). However, it doesn't work if we have cycles with negative sum (will loop forever). The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm can be used in such cases.


### Some information
Original algorithm doesn't use a min-priority queue --> O(V^2). A min-priority queue is an optimization (even faster if it's a Fibonacci heap).

This is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for directed graphs with unbounded, non-negative weights. However, specialized cases (such as bounded/integer weights, directed acyclic graphs etc.) can be improved further.

### Different implementations
There are different ways to represent a graph.

* Adjacency Matrix is preferable when we expect the graph to be dense.
* Adjacency List is preferable when we expect the graph to be sparse.


### Implementation

```java
public class Codeyay {

    /**
     * Update the min-distances and predecessors on all vertices given a certain source vertex.
     */
    public static void updateDijkstraDistances(Vertex source) {
        source.setMinDistance(0);
        PriorityQueue&lt;Vertex&gt; vertexQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();
        vertexQueue.add(source);

        while (!vertexQueue.isEmpty()) {

            // Get and remove the current prioritized vertex & visit all of its edges.
            Vertex current = vertexQueue.poll();

            for (Edge edge : current.getEdges()) {
                Vertex neighbor = edge.getDestination();
                double distanceToNeighbor = current.getMinDistance() + edge.getCost();

                // If we found a new min distance to the neighbor, update it. Note: remove
                // is O(V) and add is O(log V) so the optimized Dijkstra should use a
                // decreaseKey-operation with O(log V) time, but I'm using this for simplicity.
                if (distanceToNeighbor < neighbor.getMinDistance()) {
                    vertexQueue.remove(neighbor);
                    neighbor.setMinDistance(distanceToNeighbor);
                    neighbor.setPredecessor(current);
                    vertexQueue.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```java

public class Graph {

    private Vertex[] vertices;

    public Graph(Vertex[] vertices) {
        this.vertices = vertices;
    }

    public Vertex[] getVertices() {
        return vertices;
    }
}
```

```java
public class Vertex {

    // Properties representing the vertex itself.
    private int id;
    private Edge[] adjacencyList;

    // Properties updated by the Dijkstra algorithm depending on a given source vertex.
    private double minDistance = Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY;
    private Vertex predecessor;

    public Vertex(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    // This is needed in order to put this object in a priority queue.
    public int compareTo(Vertex other) {
        Double.compare(minDistance, other.minDistance);
    }

    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public Edge[] getEdges() {
        return adjacencyList == null ? new Edge[0] : adjacencyList;
    }

    public void setEdges(Edge[] adjacencyList) {
        this.adjacencyList = adjacencyList;
    }

    public double getMinDistance() {
        return minDistance;
    }

    public Vertex getPredecessor() {
        return predecessor;
    }

    public void setMinDistance(double minDistance) {
        this.minDistance = minDistance;
    }

    public void setPredecessor(Vertex predecessor) {
        this.predecessor = predecessor;
    }
}
```

```java
public class Edge {

    private Vertex destination;
    private double weight;

    public Edge(Vertex destination, double weight) {
        this.destination = destination;
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    public Vertex getDestination() {
        return destination;
    }

    public double getWeight() {
        return weight;
    }
}
```
